On May 15  2023  I submitted an order for goods worth over $540 from your store.  However  a significant problem has arisen that needs your prompt focus. Following the completion of the purchase  I encountered error alert on your webpage  stating that it was unable to complete my payment and that simply no funds were taken from my bank card. To my surprise  upon reviewing my banking account  I discovered that the transaction had truly been processed and the corresponding amount had been withdrawn. I need you to handle this question with the maximum urgency and fix the matter immediately. It is essential that you investigate the cause of this discrepancy and make rapid actions to return the subtracted sum. For your review and as proof of the transaction  I have presented a duplicate of my banking statement below  which obviously displays the cash withdrawal. This should serve as conclusive evidence of the transaction and emphasize the urgency of the complete refund. I will truly appreciate your immediate action.
